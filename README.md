# Coronavirus Tracker
This is a Coronavirus Tracker, provides Confirmed, Recovered, Active and Death cases per selected Country. Also does show additional information per Country. It's a simple static HTML page without any navigation.
I have built its backend using Python, Flask and REST API.
It is deployed on Heroku cloud platform.
